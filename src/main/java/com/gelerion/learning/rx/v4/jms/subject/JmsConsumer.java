/**

 *
 * Keep in mind that Observable<Message> is hot; it begins emitting JMS messages as soon as they are consumed.
 * If no one is subscribed at the moment, messages are simply lost. ReplaySubject is an alternative, but because
 * it caches all events since the application startup, itâ€™s not suitable for long-running processes. In case you
 * have a subscriber that absolutely must receive all messages, ensure that it subscribes before the JMS message
 * listener is initialized. Additionally, our message listener has a concurrency="1" parameter to ensure that
 * Subject is not invoked from multiple threads. As an alternative, you can use Subject.toSerialized().
