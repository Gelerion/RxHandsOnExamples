 * The onError notification is terminal; no other event can ever appear in such stream. Therefore, if you want to
 * signal business conditions that are potentially nonfatal, avoid onError. This is not much different from a common
 * recommendation to avoid controlling the program flow by using exceptions. Instead, in Observables consider wrapping
 * errors in special types of events that can emerge multiple times next to ordinary events. For example, if you are
 * providing a stream of transaction results and some transactions can fail due to business reasons such as insufficient
 * funds, do not use onError notification for that. Instead, consider creating a TransactionResult abstract class with
 * two concrete subclasses, each representing either success or failure. onError notification in such a stream signals
 * that something is going terribly wrong, like a catastrophic failure preventing further emission of any event.
