 *
 * timeout() operator that listens to the upstream Observable, constantly monitoring how much time elapsed since
 * the last event or subscription. If it so happens that the silence between consecutive events is longer than a
 * given period, the timeout() operator publishes an error notification that contains TimeoutException. To better
 * understand how timeout() works, first letâ€™s consider an Observable that emits only one event after a certain time.
