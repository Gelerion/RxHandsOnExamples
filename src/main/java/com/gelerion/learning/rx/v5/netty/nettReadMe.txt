Netty is entirely event-driven; we never block waiting for data to be sent or received. Instead, raw bytes in the
form of ByteBuf instances are pushed to our processing pipeline. TCP/IP gives us an impression of connection and
data flowing byte after byte between two computers. But in reality TCP/IP is built on top of IP, which can barely
transfer chunks of data known as packets. It is the operating systemâ€™s role to assemble them in the correct order
and give the illusion of a stream. Netty drops this abstraction and works at a byte-sequence layer, not a stream.
Whenever a few bytes arrive to our application, Netty will notify our handler. Whenever we send few bytes, we get a
ChannelFuture without blocking (more on futures in a second).
