The simplest onBackpressureBuffer() operator unconditionally buffers all upstream events and serves only
the requested amount of data to downstream subscribers:

    .onBackpressureBuffer()

The second parameter is optional; it is a callback invoked when the bounded buffer of 1,000 elements is fullâ€”when
despite buffering Subscriber still cannot process events at a satisfying pace. It does not allow any recovery,
so expect MissingBackpressureException immediately following the warning message. We do at least we have control
over the buffer, but not the limits of the hardware or operating system.

    .onBackpressureBuffer(1000, () -> log.warn("Buffer full"))

An alternative to onBackpressureBuffer() is onBackpressureDrop(), which simply discards all events
that appeared without prior request().

    .onBackpressureDrop(dish -> log.warn("Throw away {}", dish))
    .onBackpressureLatest()
